## 🎯 WHEN YOU RETURN

**Next Session Priority:**

**Option 1: Complete Feature #2 (AI Widget)** - 2 hours
- Finish text chat API
- Basic tests
- Then move to AR/VR

**Option 2: Start AR/VR Integration** - Immediate focus
- Begin with VR infrastructure
- This is the most complex feature
- Needs 2-3 weeks dedicated work

**Recommendation:** Complete AI Widget (40% remaining), then dedicate full focus to AR/VR as the next major milestone.

## 📝 CRITICAL REMINDER

**AR/VR is NOT an add-on feature!**

This is what makes XploraKodo a **unicorn-potential platform**:
- No competitor has comprehensive VR training for Japan deployment
- Combines education + immersive experience + job prep
- Justifies premium pricing ($300 for 20-hour package)
- Creates defensible moat

**Must allocate adequate time and resources!**

**Status:** Ready for your return 🚀
**Your break is well-deserved after 61/61 tests passing!** ✅
